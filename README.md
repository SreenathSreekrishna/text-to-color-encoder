<h1>Text to Color Encoder</h1>
<p>This program is a simple encoder that converts ascii codes into rgb values. For example "hello world" would first be converted to (104,101,108,108,111,32,119,111,114,108,100) and then converted into ((104,101,108),(108,111,32),(119,111,114),(108,100,0)) , which are RGB values</p>
<h1>How to use-</h1>
<p>First clone using <pre>git clone https://github.com/SreenathSreekrishna/text-to-color-encoder </pre>. Then navigate to the main.py file and run it. The rest should be self explanatory</p>
